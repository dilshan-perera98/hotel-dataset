735,The George Penang by The Crest Collecti,"The George, Penang, a five-storey, 92 key boutique hotel, is located in the UNESCO Heritage enclave of George Town. It is built in the style of Georgian era architecture to echo the colonial charm of 18th Century British public buildings which can be found around George Town’s Farquhar and Light Streets. The George draws inspiration from the European Renaissance Revival, which in turn has its roots in ancient Greek and Roman structures. The architectural style includes the aesthetics of symmetry, with many sturdy columns, multiple long glass windows and glass doors which bring in natural sunlight to the interior, grand balconies, higher ceilings and decorative stone vases. The colour of pristine white is predominant in the hotel's exterior, as are all buildings in the Georgian tradition. The hotel name, ""The George”, is an allusion to the era Penang was founded, a nod of respect to the then reigning monarch, King George The Third, of the British Empire. Captain Francis Light founded and named George Town after his king in 1786. The hotel has a red Morris Cooper parked outside with the number plate 1786 as a reminder of historical Penang's founding year.

1060,Sofia Boutique Hotel,"We invite you to visit the newly renovated Luxury Hotel ""Sofia"", in the historic center of Kyrenia, North Cyprus. The Hotel is located in Atilla street, 2-3 minute walk from the old port, the watchtower (now an art salon), the Church of Archangel Michael (now the Museum of Icons), the Kyrenian Fortress, in a quiet place, but near the central tourist streets, shops, cafes and restaurants. The old building has been completely preserved, the ancient walls keep the memory of many generations of travelers, and modern interiors are based on the legend of the ""Bird of Happiness"" (blue rock thrush) that once made a nest under the arches of the ancient inn of the early middle ages, which was on this place. The decoration of the Hotel is made by the world-famous master of small architectural forms, using environmentally friendly materials. You can choose three types of rooms: Standard, Luxe & De luxe. There is a large pool in the courtyard – it is open around the clock!",3,0,0,4,105.854,21.0331,1,"9 Hang Thung, Hoan

The resort is conveniently located just a 20-minute drive from Danang Airport and connects to Hoi An Ancient Town only 30 minutes and just a 15-minute drive to Danang city centre by daily shuttle service at a minimal fee. 198 rooms are spread out here falling into different categories ranging from luxurious, fully equipped suites to delightful, ocean-view bungalows that suit a wide range of customer needs from families, couples, to large groups of guests coming here for relaxation, team building, picnic, beach sports, conference, gala dinner or wedding and anniversary celebrations.
